    <p1>About me.. who is me? Me is not you and that is fact... or is it?? hmmm</p1>
    </br>

    <p3>I am kind of boring to be honest. I am a father to two beautiful and intelligent little humans and that alone takes up some good time.
        Other than that I love being creative and taking on any project even if I do not always finish, I sure like starting them. Video games and
        puzzles are always fun but not the puzzle piece puzzles, I like Rubik's and intricate ones like that. Also my spelling is not always the
        best as I was born speaking French... well, was born and then lived a bit and then learned a language and that one was French and then English
        when kindergarten started. That is about it for now! See ya and thank you for reading this and finding your way to my first webpage hehe.
