		<p1>About me.. who is me? Me is not you and that is fact... or is it?? hmmm</p1>
	</br>

		<p3>		I am kind of boring to be honest. I am a father to two beautiful and intelegent little humans and that alone takes up some good time.
			Other than that I love being creative and taking on any project even if I do not always finish, I sure like starting them. Video games and 
			puzzles are always fun but not the puzzle peice puzzles, I like Rubick's and intricate ones like that. Also my spelling is not always the 
			best as I was born speaking French... well, was born and then lived a bit and then learnt a language and that one was French and then English 
			when kindergaten started. That is about it for now! See ya and thank you for reading this and finding your way to my first webpage hehe.
