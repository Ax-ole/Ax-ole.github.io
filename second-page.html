		<p3>		This is my favourite Rubick's cube. It is a 3x3 magnetic cube that allows you to adjust the tension.
			This makes it a speed cube and my fastest time not recorder was 57 seconds and 1 minute 13 seconds recorded.
			I am not a savant or anything... You all can look up how to do it and if you buy a good cube it will most
			likely give you solutions.
