        <h1>Clash Royale</h1>
        <p>
          I am going to write information on the best mobile game in the world! You will want to play it I promise!
          
        </p>

        <p>
          What can I say about Clash Royale besides that it is the most played tower defence, live and peer to peer game in existence. 
	Ok I may be stretching this statement just a tad but regardless, I think it is very entertaining.

	Main concept is you start with a hand of cards if you will and every card has a unique character and stats. 
	Seems basic enough right? Well it is… Very much like chess and or even Yu-Gi-Oh. You have an elixir bar at the bottom 
	of your screen that replenishes at a rate of 1 elixir a second. Then when you get to the last minute things go faster 
	and faster. As the elixir now after being spent on summoning your card, now goes 2x faster. It can go up to 7x and that is 
	called the legendary infinite elixir challenge.
	
	I forgot to mention also that you can hold 8 cards per hand and no replicas… unless you are running the mirror card or clone 
	which explains itself on its own. Some cards attack only towers and others are attacking anything they can see. Trigonometry 
	plays a huge part in this game as well as physics like displacement and all that good stuff.

	Main goal is to defend your King tower and your two princesse towers as well as trying to destroy your opponent's towers. 
	Blue vs Red is what we have for Kings and for a long time the Queen was absent until a year or so ago when she made the game
	cut and now can be played on the battlefield.

	Like I said each card has its own skills however there might be a few with similar ones to make each player's decks have 
	the best synergy and versatility. Adding a spell for direct effects or damage or not running any and see how good you are. 

	If you are new and do not know what works well guess what?? There are known made decks that work very well and 
	YouTube and other platforms can teach you game plays of said deck. Long time players make their own decks and most 
	often find people that still use known decks to be rather lame instead of being creative and coming up with their own ideas and strategies.
